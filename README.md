# music-playlist-system
In order to manage music playlists effectively, we compare three different data structures (stack, linked list, and graph), with an emphasis on the ability to add, remove, shuffle, and display songs.

This comparative analysis aims to assess each data structure's effectiveness, performance, and usability for these purposes, providing insightful information that can be used to choose the best structure for a given use case in music playlist management.We examine the use of three different data structures—stacks, linked lists, and graphs—to address the effective administration of a music playlist, which includes essential features such as the ability to add and delete songs, randomly shuffle the playlist, and display the playlist.

- Stacks work best for keeping a playlist in chronological order because they employ the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method. 
- Linked lists allow for flexible playlist modifications by providing dynamic insertion and removal.
- Graphs, on the other hand, offer a more sophisticated method that makes it easier to create networked playlists and song relationships, such as organizing songs according to genre or artist.
